# 🛍 ShopEver — E-Commerce Web Application

ShopEver is a practice-based e-commerce web application that I built to understand how online shopping systems work in a real-world style environment. While working on this project, my main goal was to learn how different modules such as products, cart, wishlist, users, orders, and admin management connect and work together inside a single application.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of CRUD operations, user handling, forms, authentication flow, and basic system structure.

## ✨ User-Side Features

- Browse products and view product details
- Add items to cart
- Add and manage wishlist items
- Checkout flow for placing orders
- Login / Register authentication
- Profile & account updates
- Contact page for user queries

## 🛠 Admin Dashboard

The project also includes a separate admin section that allows:

- Adding, editing, and deleting products
- Viewing and managing user orders
- Viewing registered user accounts
- Managing messages submitted from the contact page
- Basic dashboard overview for quick access

Working on the admin panel helped me understand how backend-style management systems operate in real projects.
